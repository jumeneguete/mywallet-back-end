### ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¹Disclaimer

On this project I was training NodeJS, Express and database PostgresSQL without any appliance of clean architecture and it was my first time trainning integration tests. <br>
Later on I appplied some clean arquitecture fetures using controllers, services and repositories, and also using middleware to the authenticated routes. <br>
â†’ Soon I intend to implement integration tests to all routes.
